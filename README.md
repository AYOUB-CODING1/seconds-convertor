# ⏱️ Seconds to Hours Converter

This is a simple Python project that converts a given number of seconds into hours and minutes.

## 📚 Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey in Python.  
It helps me practice basic math, logic, and input/output in Python.

## 💡 How it works

- The program asks the user to input a number of seconds.
- It calculates how many full hours and remaining minutes there are.
- Then it displays the result clearly.

## 🧪 Example

`python
Enter seconds: 3672
Result: 1 hour(s) and 1 minute(s)
